# Performance Optimization Report - Impact Charter App

## Executive Summary
This report identifies several performance optimization opportunities in the collaborative business plan editor application built with Next.js, React, Liveblocks, and Airtable.

## Identified Performance Issues

### 1. ðŸ”´ High Priority: Unnecessary Re-renders in SectionNavigator
**Location**: `components/section-navigator.tsx`
**Issue**: The `getSectionProgress` function is called for every section on every render, and the sections data processing runs on every storage change.
**Impact**: High - This component renders frequently due to real-time collaboration features.
**Solution**: Implement React.useMemo for section progress calculations and sections data processing.

### 2. ðŸŸ¡ Medium Priority: Missing Memoization in CollaborativeTextEditor
**Location**: `components/collaborative-text-editor.tsx`
**Issue**: The component lacks memoization for expensive operations and could have unnecessary re-renders.
**Impact**: Medium - Affects typing performance in the editor.
**Solution**: Add React.useCallback for event handlers and useMemo for derived state.

### 3. ðŸŸ¡ Medium Priority: Bundle Size Optimization
**Location**: `package.json`
**Issue**: Large number of Radix UI components imported, many potentially unused.
**Impact**: Medium - Affects initial load time.
**Solution**: Audit and remove unused dependencies, implement lazy loading for heavy components.

### 4. ðŸŸ¡ Medium Priority: API Request Optimization
**Location**: `lib/airtable.ts`, API routes
**Issue**: No caching strategy for Airtable requests, potential for request batching.
**Impact**: Medium - Affects data loading performance.
**Solution**: Implement request caching and batching strategies.

### 5. ðŸŸ¢ Low Priority: Liveblocks Storage Optimization
**Location**: `components/section-navigator.tsx`, `components/collaborative-text-editor.tsx`
**Issue**: Storage operations could be optimized, debouncing could be improved.
**Impact**: Low - Minor performance gains in real-time features.
**Solution**: Optimize storage selectors and improve debouncing logic.

## Detailed Analysis

### SectionNavigator Performance Issues
The current implementation has several performance bottlenecks:
- `getSectionProgress` function is recreated on every render
- Section progress is calculated for every section on every render
- No memoization of expensive calculations
- Completed sections count is recalculated unnecessarily

### CollaborativeTextEditor Performance Issues
- Missing useCallback for event handlers
- No memoization of derived state
- Potential for unnecessary re-renders during typing

### Bundle Size Analysis
The application imports numerous Radix UI components:
- 42 different Radix UI packages in dependencies
- Many may be unused or could be lazy-loaded
- Total bundle size impact needs assessment

### API Performance Concerns
- No request caching for Airtable operations
- Each section save triggers individual API calls
- No request deduplication or batching

## Recommended Implementation Order
1. Fix SectionNavigator re-renders (High impact, low effort) âœ… **IMPLEMENTED**
2. Add memoization to CollaborativeTextEditor (Medium impact, low effort)
3. Bundle size optimization (Medium impact, medium effort)
4. API request optimization (Medium impact, high effort)
5. Liveblocks optimization (Low impact, medium effort)

## Implementation Details - SectionNavigator Optimization

### Changes Made:
1. Added React import for useMemo and useCallback hooks
2. Memoized `getSectionProgress` function with useCallback
3. Memoized `completedSections` count calculation
4. Created `sectionProgressMap` with useMemo to avoid recalculating progress in render loop

### Performance Benefits:
- Reduces function recreations on every render
- Eliminates redundant section progress calculations
- Improves performance during real-time collaboration scenarios
- Maintains existing functionality while optimizing render cycles

## Metrics to Track
- Component render frequency
- Bundle size reduction
- Time to interactive (TTI)
- API request frequency and response times
- Memory usage during collaborative editing

## Next Steps
1. Implement CollaborativeTextEditor memoization
2. Conduct bundle size audit and optimization
3. Add API request caching layer
4. Optimize Liveblocks storage operations
5. Add performance monitoring and metrics collection
